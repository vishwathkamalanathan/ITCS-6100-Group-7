## Business Opportunity and Domain Knowledge

### Business Problem/ Opportunity:

Buying a new property has always been a hustle. When people look out to buy a new house, they tend to be more conservative towards budget and market strategies. They attempt to optimize the budget to meet their requirements and needs. The perfect home meets and matches the customer's needs while staying within their budget. So, when it comes to budgeting, price prediction is crucial. People typically approach a real estate manager or an agent who predicts prices. It's beneficial but would raise costs because you must pay a commission to the manager. Instead, we are trying to build a model that helps to predict house prices by considering the prime features.

### Domain: 

Real-Estate, Sales, and Finance


### Domain Knowledge:

According to the California Census data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, each block group in California includes ten metrics, including population, proximity to the ocean, total room space, and bedroom details in the home. It aims to specify the project's functional and non-functional requirements and to serve as a resource for defining the project's scope.

Housing market is one of the most important indicators of economic development in a region. A strong housing market in a region signals strong economic growth.
